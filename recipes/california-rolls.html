<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare rice first by cooking in a 1 to 1 ratio with water. 
        If you don't have sushi rice, any short to medium grain rice will work.
    </li>
    <li>After rice is cooked, cool for 20 min. This is very important to ensure 
        that your rice has the correct texture and it not too mushy later on!
     </li>
    <li>Add rice vinegar, salt, and sugar to rice and mix into rice with 
        rice paddle. 
    </li>
    <li>Cut avocado into thin strips</li>
    <li>Cut nori down to size and place on seran wrap. Press rice down all over nori</li>
    <li>Add imitation crab and avocado</li>
    <li>Roll up sushi with seran wrap. Do not press down too much, just try to get a cylinder like shape. Seal the roll
        by "gluing" the nori with water.
    </li>
    <li> Take off the seran wrap and cut into pieces with a sharp knife.</li>
    <li>Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and ginger and enjoy!</li>
